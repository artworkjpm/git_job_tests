I used CREATE-REACT-APP to make this Order Exporer.

Once you app is almost ready, how will you deploy the service to a cloud hosting? You can try to summarize your solution using -

1. CI/CD? How? Which tools?
   I have used **TeamCity** at 15below, my previous employer in Brighton, UK. However I am not an expert on this subject, I cannot decide what is best because I don't have the skills or knowledge to decide this. I personally use **Netlify** to bundle and host my github repositories, it is free and works well, but for a large ecommerce site like yours it probably will not be sufficient, that why I mentioned **TeamCity**.
2. Monitoring & Alerts? Any concrete tool? Logging?
   This is not my field of expertise, yet, I cannot answer this.
3. Deployment - Microplatform (AMI) vs Kubernetes?
   This is not my field of expertise, yet, I cannot answer this.

Run `npm install`, then:

### `npm start`

to view the app

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
