## I used CREATE-REACT-APP to make this Order Exporer.

Run `npm install`, then:

### `npm start`

to view the app

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
